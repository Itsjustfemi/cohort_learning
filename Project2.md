# LEMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION
I Started my Ec2 Instance and Connected through SSH `ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP-address>`
Command 1$2. I updated the ubuntu server and also installed the Nginx.
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install nginx`

**ROADBLOCK 1**
The above two command ran well. However, when I ran the systemcheck command, it did not show green. Refer to screenshot below.
